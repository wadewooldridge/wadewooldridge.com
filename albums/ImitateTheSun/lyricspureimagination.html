<h3>Pure Imagination</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley</h4>
<p>Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination.<br>
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination.<br>
We'll begin with a spin, traveling in this world of my creation.<br>
What we find will defy explanation.</p>
<p>If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it.<br>
Anything you want to, do it.<br>
Wanna change the world? There's nothing to it.</p>
<p>There is no place to go to compare with pure imagination,<br>
Living there, you'll be free if you truly wish to be.</p>
<p>You will find in your mind there's a world of pure imagination.<br>
No more fun place to be than in your imagination.<br>
You can dream any dream; you can savor every situation.<br>
Life in there's a sensational sensation.</p>
<p>If you want to see magic lands, simply close your eyes and see one.<br>
Wanna be a dreamer? Be one.<br>
Any dream you please, but please save me one.</p>
<p>There is no place I know to compare with pure imagination,<br>
So go there and be free if you truly wish to be.<br>

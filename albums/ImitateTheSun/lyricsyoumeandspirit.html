<h3>You, Me, and Spirit</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Wade R. Wooldridge</h4>
<p>Looking back and seeing all the damage that I've done.<br>
Looking in at just how far I've had to come.<br>
I'm looking out this time for more than only number one.<br>
Looking forward to what you and I become.</p>
<p>Loving you, the beautiful blossom of the spring,<br>
Loving me, the summer robin as he sings.<br>
Loving life itself and all the magic that it brings.<br>
Loving Spirit, creating everything.</p>
<p>Chorus:<br>
And I give thanks this day for all the love that comes my way.<br>
I know I will never be alone.<br>
'Cause Spirit sees me through, as sure as I'm in love with you,<br>
As sure as anything I've every known.</p>
<p>Letting you evolve into the things you know you must.<br>
Letting me be free and know that love is just<br>
Letting go of fear and then surrendering to trust.<br>
Letting Spirit deliver it to us.</p>
<p>(Chorus)<br>
(Chorus)</p>

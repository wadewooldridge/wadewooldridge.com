<h3>Woman-Child</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Wade R. Wooldridge</h4>
<p>When you were a child, you spoke as a child:<br>
You danced and you sang and you played.<br>
But as you got older, they squashed and controlled her.<br>
The little girl's there, and she knows you still care,<br>
But she just can't get over the pain.</p>
<p>When you were a child, you loved as a child:<br>
You shared and you touched and you gave.<br>
But as you got wiser, you learned to disguise her,<br>
And keep men in line, as you give them some time,<br>
But never the love that you save.</p>
<p>Chorus:<br>
So bring out the child in the woman.<br>
Hug her and hold her and brush out her hair.<br>
She just needs to know it's okay to be hurting,<br>
And not have to fear if a man sees the tear<br>
Of the child you have hidden in there.</p>
<p>When you were a child, you hoped as a child:<br>
You dreamed and prayed and you longed.<br>
But as they denied you, the dreams died inside you.<br>
You made up your mind that the world was unkind,<br>
And you vowed never more to be wronged.</p>
<p>(Chorus)<br>
(Chorus)<br>

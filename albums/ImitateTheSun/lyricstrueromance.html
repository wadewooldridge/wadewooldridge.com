<h3>True Romance</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Wade R. Wooldridge</h4>
<p><span class="italicize">He</span>: No Tara belle with iron will, no pie-eyed damsel feigning
need.<br>
I see the woman you are, and still, I see my chosen queen.<br>
<span class="italicize">She</span>: No swarthy hero from distant shore, no armored knight on trusty
steed.<br>
I see the man you are, and more, I see my chosen king.</p>
<p><span class="italicize">Both</span>: 'Cause fairy tales grow old and stale. Fantasies all fade.<br>
But here and now with you somehow, true romance is what remains.<br>
With you I see reality that true romance creates.<br>
With you I see reality that true romance creates.</p>
<p><span class="italicize">He</span>: No stunning babe of cold allure, no Amazon, no doting wife.<br>
I see the woman you are, and I'm sure, I see my chosen life.<br>
<span class="italicize">She</span>: No struggling artist filled with pain, no fancy suit, imported
car.<br>
I see the man you are, and then, I see my chosen star.</p>
<p><span class="italicize">Both</span>: 'Cause fairy tales grow old and stale. Fantasies all fade.<br>
But here and now with you somehow, true romance is what remains.<br>
With you I see reality that true romance creates.<br>
With you I see reality that true romance creates.</p>
<p><span class="italicize">Both</span>: 'Cause love unveils those fairy tales. Fantasies come true.<br>
But here and now with you somehow, true romance is born anew.<br>
With you I see reality that true romance creates.<br>
With you I see reality that true romance creates.<br>

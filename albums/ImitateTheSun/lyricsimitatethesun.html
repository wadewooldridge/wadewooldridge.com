<h3>Imitate The Sun</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Leslie Bricusse and Allan Jay Friedman</h4>
<p>I will imitate the sun like no man has ever done,<br>
And like the sun illuminate the day.<br>
To this I do avow: to climb on higher now,<br>
And break on through the mists and light the way.</p>
<p>I will do what's there to do; I will see what's there to see.<br>
I'll throw away my limitations, taste eternity.<br>
No star will be too far; no wish will be too much.<br>
The world is mine to make divine, and God is there to touch.</p>
<p>I will love with all my heart; see the whole and not the part.<br>
This dream asleep inside of me I'll wake and make reality for all to see.<br>
I will live the life I choose, no matter what I win or lose.<br>
I will challenge fate; I will imitate the sun.<br>
</p>

<h3>Our Thoughts Are Prayers</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Lucille K. Olson</h4>
<p>Our thoughts are prayers, and we are always praying.<br>
Our thoughts are prayers; listen to what you're saying.<br>
Seek a higher consciousness, a state of peacefulness,<br>
And know that God is always there,<br>
And every thought becomes a prayer.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are prayers, the tools that we create with.<br>
Our thoughts are prayers that Spirit resonates with.<br>
Seek a higher consciousness, a state of mindfulness,<br>
And know that God is always there,<br>
And every thought becomes a prayer.<br>
</p>

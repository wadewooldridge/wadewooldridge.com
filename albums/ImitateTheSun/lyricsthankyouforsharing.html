<h3>Thank You For Sharing</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Dale Gonyea and Nikki Byers</h4>
<p>I tried, &quot;Dominus vobiscum,&quot; &quot;Glory Hallelujah!&quot;<br>
&quot;Namyoho rengekyo,&quot; and brother, what's it to ya?<br>
But there's a simple phrase that let's me know that I'm OK.<br>
It's useful in relationships; I say it every day.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing. Thank you for playing out your role.<br>
Thank you for sharing. It's fun to dominate, manipulate, and control.<br>
How great am I willing to have it? How much good will I allow?<br>
Thank you for sharing. Tomorrow I'll start living in the now.</p>
<p>I've aligned with you, time and again, for the highest good for you and
me.<br>
We've been such clear channels since we picked up NBC.<br>
Each time I acted out on you, you instantly forgave,<br>
So I'll love you unconditionally, just as long as you behave.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing. (You're beautiful.) Thank you for being who you
are.<br>
Thank you for sharing. Take a risk, but not while you're driving my new
car.<br>
I used to think my soulmate was on the bottom of my other shoe.<br>
Thank you for sharing. Can I help it if my truth is a little more true?</p>
<p>Once you came home in a rotten mood, so I thought I'd help you win.<br>
I said, &quot;How did you create that?&quot; and you kicked me in the
shin.<br>
You said, &quot;How did you create that?&quot; and I didn't say a word.<br>
What came up for me right then was just that sometimes you can be a turd.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing. (Turds are people, too.) Thank you for stating
your case.<br>
Thank you for sharing. You're a gift, now please won't you get out of
my space?<br>
The synergy between us is a rare phenomenon,<br>
And now we both have someone we can dump our garbage on.</p>
<p>When I told you I was sick of processing and starting to get hoarse,<br>
You went into reaction and you told me to go to the Source.<br>
Now that I finally &quot;got it,&quot; I don't worry, I don't fret.<br>
I took a loan from Master Card and I paid off my karmic debt.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing. (Let's communicate.) Sharing is time well spent.<br>
Thank you for sharing. I'll support you, but don't ask me to pay your
rent.<br>
You might want to look at that. Can you take feedback? Not today?<br>
Thank you for sharing. You're completely screwed up but that's OK.</p>
<p>When my mind does monkey chatter, and I feel that I might snap!<br>
That still, small voice inside me will not shut its little trap!<br>
I wanna do! Be! Have! Be! Do! Be! Dooby dooby do!<br>
But I must acknowledge myself for trying to press through. (Don't try;
do.)</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing. (I acknowledge you.) Thank you for playing in
my key.<br>
Thank you for sharing. I don't mind that you're not as enlightened as
me, you see,<br>
I finally dropped my ego, and it really set me free.<br>
Now I'm very proud to say, there's no one in the whole, wide world<br>
Who is as whole, complete, and perfect as me! As me! Not you! But me!<br>

<h3>My Little Space</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Wade R. Wooldridge</h4>
<p>My little space has the walls painted white<br>
To make it seem airy or cozy or light.<br>
There's ants in the kitchen; the bathroom's a fright.<br>
The landlord is busy, but always polite.<br>
And on Christmas he sends me a card.</p>
<p>I'm so small it's disgusting, and that's why I say I belong.</p>
<p>My little space on the seventeenth floor<br>
Has carpet for walls and a hole for a door,<br>
A view of the name of the worker next door,<br>
And ten percent off at the company store.<br>
And on Christmas they give me a turkey.</p>
<p>I'm so small it's disgusting, and that's why I say I belong.<br>
I'm so weak it's pathetic, and that's why I say that I'm strong.</p>
<p>My little space seen from ten thousand feet<br>
Is one little box down on one tiny street,<br>
With thousands of boxes arranged nice and neat<br>
When seen from the view of this small window seat.<br>
And on Christmas the movie is free.</p>
<p>I'm so small it's disgusting, and that's why I say I belong.<br>
I'm so weak it's pathetic, and that's why I say that I'm strong.<br>
I'm so dumb it's amazing, but I'll never admit when I'm wrong.<br>

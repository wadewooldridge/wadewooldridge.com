<h3>Welcome To My Morning (Farewell Andromeda)</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by John Denver</h4>
<p>Welcome to my morning, welcome to my day,<br>
Oh yes, I'm the one responsible, I made it just this way<br>
To make myself some pictures, see what they might bring.<br>
I think I made it perfectly. I wouldn't change a thing.</p>
<p>Welcome to my happiness, you know it makes me smile<br>
And it pleases me to have you here for just a little while,<br>
While we open up some spaces and try to break some chains,<br>
And if the truth is told, they will never come again.</p>
<p>Welcome to my evening, the closing of the day.<br>
You know I could try a million times, never find a better way<br>
To tell you that I love you, and all the songs I play<br>
Are to thank you for allowing me in this lovely day you made.</p>
<p>Welcome to my morning, welcome to my day,<br>
Oh yes, I'm the one responsible, I made it just this way<br>
To make myself some pictures, see what they might bring.<br>
I think I made it perfectly. I wouldn't change a thing.<br>

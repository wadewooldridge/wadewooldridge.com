<h3>Stand Upon My Shoulders</h3>
<h4>A song for my father, Earl Wooldridge</h4>
<h4>Words and Music by Wade R. Wooldridge</h4>
<p>A simple man from Illinois, defender of the law,<br>
Seldom showed his love or pain or fear,<br>
Raised a girl and two tough boys the best way that he saw.<br>
My father always told me in the words I could not hear:</p>
<p>Chorus:<br>
Stand upon my shoulders and reach more than I could touch.<br>
I would not live your life for you, but I would give you just this much.<br>
Stand upon my shoulders and see what I could not.<br>
Take these words I give to you,<br>
No matter what you see and do (win or lose),<br>
Appreciate the good things that you've got.</p>
<p>I'm blessed with happy, healthy boys, almost pass for twins,<br>
Quickly go from frowns to smiles to tears.<br>
Remind me of the simple joys, like when I tuck them in,<br>
I pull the sheets up over them and whisper in their ears:</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Someday my sons will know me as a simple man who tried<br>
To give them things they did not know they'd need.<br>
And when their sons are growing up, and granddad's gone and died.<br>
They'll look into their hearts and see the place I put the seed:</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Papa, I can love you now in ways I could not then.<br>
I see you in the father I've become.<br>
Now your job's completed; I'd be proud to be your friend.<br>
I can hear your words now, and even give you some:</p>
<p>(Chorus)<br>
</p>

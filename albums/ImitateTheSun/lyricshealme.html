<h3>Heal Me</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Kevin Stokes and Connie Harrington</h4>
<p>It's another good-to-see-you Sunday morning.<br>
Oh, I hardly hear the words roll off my tongue.<br>
Looking in myself for signs of something that seems gone.</p>
<p>Oh, I stumble through a verse that says God love me.<br>
As the voices echo, my thoughts drift away.<br>
And I close my eyes, ashamed I'm feeling nothing.<br>
And I pray, I pray:</p>
<p>Heal me. Heal these eyes. Heal this heart. Heal my mind.<br>
Breathe the breath of Life.<br>
Heal me. Wake this soul from its sleep.<br>
Give me back the joy of when I first believed.<br>
Heal me.</p>
<p>Oh, I lose myself in one more day's indifference,<br>
When my eyes are everywhere but fixed on Cause.<br>
I don't know how to overcome this distance,<br>
But I know something inside me does.</p>
<p>Heal me. Heal these eyes. Heal this heart. Heal my mind.<br>
Breathe the breath of Life.<br>
Heal me. Wake this soul from its sleep.<br>
Give me back the joy of when I first believed.<br>
Heal me. Oh, heal me.</p>
<p>I don't want to waste another minute taking all this love for granted.<br>
I align with the Holy Spirit rushin' through me.</p>
<p>And now I see, open eyes, open heart, open mind.<br>
I breathe the breath of Life.<br>
Now I see, and my soul soars free<br>
In the everlasting joy when I believe.<br>
I'm healed. Oh, I'm healed.<br>

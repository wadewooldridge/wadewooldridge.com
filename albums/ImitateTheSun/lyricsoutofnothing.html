<h3>Out Of Nothing</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Kimberly Wooldridge and Wade R. Wooldridge</h4>
<p>Out of nothing, God spoke a Word and made a world:<br>
The Earth and sky and sea, the plants and flowers and me.<br>
It all is meant to grow, and every thought we sow<br>
In Spirit's perfect Law comes to be.</p>
<p>Chorus:<br>
At times I thought myself not good enough.<br>
I made my life ungodly tough.<br>
I felt the lonely sorrow of love not given, only borrowed,<br>
But love lives in this moment here.<br>
The past is only shame and fear.<br>
The past fades to nothing, nothing now&#133;</p>
<p>Out of nothing, I speak my word and make my world:<br>
Work and home and family, passion and vitality.<br>
It all is meant to teach, a different lesson each,<br>
Of kindness, love, trust or harmony.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Out of nothing, you speak your word and make your world:<br>
The people that you draw to you, and everything you say and do.<br>
It all is meant to change, to grow and rearrange,<br>
And open up our eyes so we can see.</p>
<p>We've each felt our share of hurt and shame,<br>
But we created it; no one's to blame,<br>
And we choose whether it will stay the same.</p>
<p>And so I know that I am good enough.<br>
I fill my life with God and love.<br>
I throw away the sorrow, and give back all the love I've borrowed.<br>
But love lives in this moment here.<br>
The past is only shame and fear.<br>
The past fades to nothing, nothing now&#133;</p>
<p>Out of nothing, I speak my word and make my world.<br>

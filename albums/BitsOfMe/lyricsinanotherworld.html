<h3>In Another World</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Wade Wooldridge</h4>
<h4>A song for Mark after his suicide.</h4>
<p>In another world you might have lived to thirty,<br>
Loved and lost, and loved again more true.<br>
Found a trade, and made a name,<br>
Learned to live without the blame,<br>
Shared yourself so someone really knew you.</p>
<p>Forever twenty, a shame you never grew into a man,<br>
And we all wonder how your life might have unfurled.<br>
We go on without you, and wonder what it was about you.<br>
I'll ask you when I see you in another world.</p>
<p>In another world you might have lived to forty,<br>
Settled down, had children of your own.<br>
Learned to live, to freely give,<br>
Gained a new perspective,<br>
Seen your liimitations as they'd grown.</p>
<p>Forever twenty, a waste you never grew into a man,<br>
And we all wonder how your life might have unfurled.<br>
We go on without you, and wonder what it was about you.<br>
I'll ask you when I see you in another world.</p>
<p>In another world you might have lived to fifty,<br>
Sang and danced and written songs of grace.<br>
If you have stayed you would have made<br>
A difference to so many.<br>
This world would surely be a better place.</p>
<p>Forever twenty, a shame you never grew into a man,<br>
And we all wonder how your life might have unfurled.<br>
We go on without you, and wonder what it was about you.<br>
I'll ask you when I see you in another world.<br>

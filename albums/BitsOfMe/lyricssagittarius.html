<h3>Sagittarius</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Wade Wooldridge</h4>
<p>Way up there in Sagittarius, there is a start too far for us to see.<br>
It shares its light with a million other worlds, but not with me.<br>
And I could wonder what the sky'd be like, if all the stars were in my
sight.<br>
Instead I'll love the light from all the stars I can see.</p>
<p>Little sun, the world outside is only one of many worlds where we can
play,<br>
And so I thank you for today.</p>
<p>Across the sea in Catalonia, there is a girl that we will never know.<br>
She shares her smile with a hundred of her friends, her face aglow.<br>
And I could wonder how my life would go, if I could touch a billion souls.<br>
Instead I'll cherish all the good friends that I do know.</p>
<p>Like the diamonds in the sky,<br>
This world is full of wonders that can make me cry.</p>
<p>Little one, the world of loive is only one of many world for us to play,<br>
And so I bless you for today.</p>
<p>One Spring day a hundred years from now, the moment comes long after
I am gone,<br>
When every soul sees the folly of its fears, and peace can dawn.<br>
And I could hear the Music of the Spheres, if I could live a thousand
years.<br>
Instead I'll cherish every moment that I live one.</p>
<p>Little sun, the world of now is only one of many worlds were we can play,<br>
And so I bless you for today.</p>
<p>How I wonder what we are.<br>

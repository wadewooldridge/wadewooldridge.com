<h3>I Like Our Way Better</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Wade Wooldridge</h4>
<h4>A song for Kimberly's birthday.</h4>
<p>Today let's lift weights and play racquetball,<br>
Get too competitive while we perspire.<br>
This evening we'll dine and sip on red wine,<br>
And talk with our friends as we sit 'round the fire.</p>
<p>So long as when we look back at all<br>
The wonderful ways we life each other higher.<br>
I know in my core that I love you more.<br>
My goal's to fulfill each and every desire you have.</p>
<p>I like our way better.<br>
So what if this is as good as it gets?<br>
Our charmed life together.<br>
You put up with snoring; I put up with cigarettes...<br>
I still like our way better.</p>
<p>From Landmark we get brutal honesty.<br>
From Science of Mind we let God see us through.<br>
Aikido to stand-up, who knows where we'll end up.<br>
It's always a blast when I do it with you.</p>
<p>Any there's so much more world for us to see:<br>
Europe to Egypt, and China, Peru.<br>
We'll live for today, but still sock some away.<br>
Tomorrow's a chance to create something new with you.</p>
<p>I like our way better.<br>
There's plenty of meat still attached to those bones.<br>
Our charmed life together.<br>
Christmastime every year, back to our parents' homes...<br>
I still like our way better.</p>
<p>Your Mom says we're farts in a whirlwind.<br>
Your Dad says our dryer is shrinking your pants.<br>
Our parents, it seems, have abandoned their dreams,<br>
And all they can do is look at us askance as we</p>
<p>Keep being boyfriend and girlfriend,<br>
With writing and acting and singing and dance.<br>
Two cerebral cortexes merging their vortexes,<br>
Looking to find our own kind of romance.</p>
<p>I like our way better.<br>
So what if this is as good as it gets?<br>
Our charmed life together.<br>
You put up with snoring; I put up with cigarettes...<br>
I still like our way better.<br>

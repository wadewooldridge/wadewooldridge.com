<h3>Hanyo Blues</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Wade Wooldridge and Kimberly Wooldridge</h4>
<h4>In celebration of the birthday of the incomparable Hans Smith.</h4>
<p>You say it's time to party, and you got the wine and beer.<br>
Well the party can't get started yet, 'nless Yes! Hanyo's here.<br>
He's got a kiss for every lady, but always time for you.<br>
When you're as smooth as Hanyo, there's always more to do.</p>
<p>Born the son of a Nobel man, half a world away.<br>
When he was just a little tyke he came to the U.S.A.<br>
He's never met a stranger, from China to Germany.<br>
When you're as worldly as Hanyo, there's always more to see.</p>
<p>He's at his most amazing behind the microphone.<br>
Guitar in his hand, Hey! Come play me some Stones!<br>
He's played some rock, he's played some blues, but always his own way.<br>
When you're as musical as Hanyo, there's always more to play.</p>
<p>He spends his daylight hours in artistic cultivation.<br>
But the most important seeds he sows are of Illumination.<br>
He makes the world a better place, wherever he may go.<br>
When you're enlightened as Hanyo, there's always more to grow.</p>
<p>With a Panama atop him, and Birkenstocks below,<br>
Hanyo takes his own style wherever he may go.<br>
From fire pits to food and friends, he sure knows how to live.<br>
When you're as generous as Hanyo, there's always more to give.<br>

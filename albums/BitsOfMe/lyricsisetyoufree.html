<h3>I Set You Free</h3>
<h4>Words and Music by Wade Wooldridge</h4>
<h4>A song for Mark and Scott, when they decided as teenagers to pull back from me.</h4>
<p>I knew this day would come, but I thought I had another year or two.<br>
I know what must be done, my son. I shake your hand and give your life
to you.</p>
<p>I let you go. I set you free. I'll watch you grow;<br>
I long to see the man that you become eventually.<br>
I let you go. I let it be. You don't yet know how hard it is for me<br>
To say these words: I love you so. I set you free.</p>
<p>I thought I'd have more time to share with you the lessons I have learned.<br>
But as the years unwind, you'll find, you can't flip back the pages that
have turned.</p>
<p>I let you go. I set you free. I'll watch you grow;<br>
I long to see the man that you become eventually.<br>
I let you go. I let it be. You don't yet know how hard it is for me<br>
To say these words: I love you so. I set you free.</p>
<p>I never thought you had to be like me.<br>
I never asked you for perfection.<br>
This is the right place for you to be.<br>
But still it hurts to feel this rejection.</p>
<p>So every day my prayer is that you grow up strong and kind and smart.<br>
That you live full out and dare to share the perfect gift that lives inside
your heart.</p>
<p>I let you go. I set you free. I'll watch you grow;<br>
I long to see the man that you become eventually.<br>
I let you go. I let it be. You don't yet know how hard it is for me<br>
To say these words: I love you so. I set you free.<br>

        <blockquote>"Actors in any capacity, artists of any stripe, are inspired by their curiosity, by their desire to
            explore all quarters of life, in light and in dark, and reflect what they find in their work.
            Artists instinctively want to reflect humanity, their own and each other's, in all its intermittent
            virtue and vitality, frailty and fallibility."

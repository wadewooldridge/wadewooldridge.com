    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">
        <p>I am an experienced software developer with a wide breadth of experience, primarily in lower-level
            code such as device drivers and firmware for storage and networking devices.</p>
        <p>I am currently retraining with LearningFuze in full-stack web development, and I am seeking a
            position that will leverage those skills. This would most likely be a position that makes use of
            my web programming skills, most likely on the back end to take advantage of my strength in programming.</p>
        <p>I also bring a variety of "soft" skills to any employer: I have excellent communications skills, whether it
            is presenting, writing, or proofreading. I have been a key data organizer in previous companies, creating
            and maintaining internal Wiki sites and document repositories.</p>
